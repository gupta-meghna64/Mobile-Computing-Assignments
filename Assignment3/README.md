## Sensor Data Application
<p>This android application collects time-stamped sensor data in the background for the following sensors:
<ul>
<li> Accelerometer </li>
<li> GPS </li>
<li> Wi-Fi Access Points </li>
<li> Microphone </li>
<li> Gyroscope </li>
</ul>
<br>
It also allows the user to store the data in a SQLite database and show it when requested. The user can also export the sensor data to a CSV file, which is stored in the user's phone storage.
