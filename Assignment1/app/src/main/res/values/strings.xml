    <string name="flower_description">A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms).
            \n\nThe biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs.
            \n\nIn addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to bring beauty to their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food.</string>
